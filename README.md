Welcome to my front-end engineering journey!

I recently discovered my passion for web development, specifically front-end engineering. While my major has provided a solid foundation in information management principles, I’ve always felt there was a gap in my skills — and now I’m taking the first step to bridge that gap.

My First Web Development Project:

This repository contains my first foray into web development: a resume website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m proud to say that this project is the result of my self-directed learning and experimentation with web development concepts.

What’s Next:

This project marks the beginning of my web development journey. I’m excited to continue learning, building new projects, and applying my skills in real-world settings. I look forward to contributing to the web development community and growing as a front-end engineer.
